 # Paper Airplane Numerical Study
  Final Project: AEM 3103 Spring 2024

  - By: Daniel Tereshko & Ashton Rodgers

  ## Summary of Findings
  <Show the variations studied in a table>

  This study aimed to analyze the trajectory of a paper airplane. The data used was that for an equilibrium glide at a maximum lift/ drag ratio from the file paperplane.m. There were three major findings; If the plane is thrown at its max velocity, it will always pitch up and sometimes even flip over. The plane will also always return to trim. Lastly the plane   "Paper Airplane Flight Path" which was gathered by Robert Stengel. Summarized what was accomplished in this study.  Describe 2-4 observations from simulating the flight path.
  Reference the figures below as needed.

  *If the analysis falls short of the goal, this is your chance to explain what was done or what were the barriers.*
 
  # Code Listing
  A list of each function/script and a single-line description of what it does.  The name of the function/script should link to the file in the repository on GitHub.
